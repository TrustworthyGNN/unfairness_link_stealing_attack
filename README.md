# unfairness in link stealing attack


## Step 1: Train Target Model

Train GCN and MLP for all datasets.

Train GCN: 

```bash
python3 train.py --dataset cora --model gcn
```

Train MLP: 

```bash
python3 train.py --dataset cora --model mlp
```

## Step 2: Generate Partial Graph
Split train / test for all datasets.

```bash
python3 partial_graph_generation.py --dataset cora
```

## Step 3: Run Attacks
Note that all attacks rely on the partial graphs generated by Step 2.
### Attack 0
```bash
python3 attack.py --dataset cora
```

### Note
Note that in the code we use standard scaler to fit the training data and testing data separately as we assume that the adversary may acquire the whole testing data at the beginning. 

```
ss = StandardScaler()
x_train = ss.fit_transform(x_train)
x_test = ss.fit_transform(x_test)
```

but please feel free to modify it into:
```
ss = StandardScaler()
x_train = ss.fit_transform(x_train)
x_test = ss.transform(x_test)
```
